 ## Instructions on How to Host Your Résumé 
 
 ### 1. Getting Started
 ####   A. Creating a GitHub Account
   In order to be able to host your résumé on GitHub Pages, you will first need to have a GitHub account. The following steps will help you create a GitHub account:   
   1. [Click here](https://github.com/join) to begin initial setup of your account.
   2. Fill in the required fields from the link above to set up your account. You will need to create a username and password, and have a valid email address.
   3. Click Select a Plan once you have finished filling in the fields. 
   4. Choose a plan that is right for you. You can create a free account, or, if you wish, you can choose a Pro account, which costs $7 USD per month.  
      * You will be able to do all required steps to host your résumé using a free account.
   5. You will then arrive at a page that looks something like this: ![welcome to github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57049086/67638774-93dd4900-f8b6-11e9-87b9-acaa70c4e041.JPG)
      Once you arrive at this page you have two options: 
          1. Fill out the questions on this page, and hit submit
          2. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click "skip this step"
          
   6. Check your email, and click on the link in the email from GitHub to verify your email. **This is important, as you will not be able to proceed in creating your account unless you verify your email address. If your email address is invalid, or you do not have an email, you will not be able to continue creating an account. Also, if you do not see the email, check your spam/junk folder, as it may have gone into there.**
  7. Once your email was verified, create a new repository by entering a name for it, and then clicking submit. Your repository will be where you store your files. **Note: On the page, it will give you the option of choosing a public or private repository. You can choose either. However, if you would like to use GitHub Pages, you either need to have a public account, or, you must have a GitHub Pro account (essentially, pay $7 USD per month for your account).
  8. Congratulations! Your GitHub account is now set up and ready for use.
